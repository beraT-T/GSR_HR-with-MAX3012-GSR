Measuring stress with Heart rate and Galvanic Skin Response 

This project aims to measure stress levels using the *MAX30102 pulse oximeter and *Groove GSR sensor. Data from these sensors will be processed and analyzed to estimate stress levels.

#Overview

- **MAX30102 Sensor**: Measures heart rate and oxygen saturation.
- **GSR Sensor**: Analyzes skin conductivity to determine stress levels.
- **Data Processing**: Raw sensor data will be filtered and analyzed.
- **Visualization**: The results will be displayed using graphs or a dashboard.
- **Logging & Storage**: Both sensor data and generated stress variable will be recorded and stored for further analysis.
